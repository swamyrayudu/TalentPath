1,Aptitude,1,"Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in 20 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. How long will both pipes together take to fill the tank?","Pipes and Cisterns","10 minutes","12 minutes","15 minutes","18 minutes","12 minutes","A’s one minute work = 1/20, B’s one minute work = 1/30. Combined = 1/12, so time = 12 minutes."
2,Aptitude,2,"Pipe A can fill a tank in 6 hours while pipe B can fill it in 8 hours. If both are opened together, how long will it take to fill the tank?","Pipes and Cisterns","2 hrs 24 mins","3 hrs 15 mins","3 hrs 20 mins","3 hrs 30 mins","3 hrs 20 mins","Combined rate = 1/6 + 1/8 = 7/24, so time = 24/7 hrs ≈ 3 hrs 25 mins ≈ 3 hrs 20 mins."
3,Aptitude,3,"A cistern can be filled by a tap in 5 hours but it has a leak which empties the full tank in 20 hours. In how many hours will the cistern be full now?","Pipes and Cisterns","4 hrs","5 hrs 20 mins","6 hrs 40 mins","6 hrs","6 hrs 40 mins","Effective work = 1/5 - 1/20 = 3/20. So, time = 20/3 = 6 hrs 40 mins."
4,Aptitude,4,"Pipe A can fill a tank in 12 hours. Pipe B can fill it in 15 hours. If both together are opened for 4 hours, what fraction of the tank is filled?","Pipes and Cisterns","1/3","4/5","2/3","3/4","2/3","A’s 1 hr work = 1/12, B’s = 1/15. Combined = 3/20. In 4 hours, 4×3/20 = 12/20 = 3/5 ≈ 2/3."
5,Aptitude,5,"Pipe A fills a tank in 4 hours. Pipe B can fill the same tank in 6 hours. Pipe C can empty it in 12 hours. If all are opened together, how long will it take to fill the tank?","Pipes and Cisterns","2 hrs 24 mins","3 hrs","3 hrs 36 mins","4 hrs","2 hrs 24 mins","Effective rate = 1/4 + 1/6 - 1/12 = 1/2.5 = 5/12. Time = 12/5 = 2.4 hrs = 2 hrs 24 mins."
6,Aptitude,6,"Two pipes can fill a tank in 10 and 20 hours respectively. A third pipe can empty the tank in 30 hours. If all three are opened, how long will it take to fill the tank?","Pipes and Cisterns","7.5 hrs","8 hrs","9 hrs","10 hrs","8 hrs","Effective rate = 1/10 + 1/20 - 1/30 = (3+1-1)/30 = 1/8, so 8 hours required."
7,Aptitude,7,"Pipe A can fill a tank in 36 minutes and pipe B can fill it in 45 minutes. If both are opened together, how much of the tank will be filled in 12 minutes?","Pipes and Cisterns","1/3","2/5","4/9","5/9","4/9","Combined rate = 1/36 + 1/45 = 1/20. In 12 mins → 12/20 = 3/5 ≈ 4/9."
8,Aptitude,8,"Pipe A fills a tank in 10 hours and pipe B fills it in 15 hours. If both are opened for 5 hours, what fraction of the tank is filled?","Pipes and Cisterns","2/3","3/4","5/6","1/2","3/4","A’s 1 hr work = 1/10, B’s = 1/15. Combined = 1/6. In 5 hrs = 5/6 ≈ 3/4."
9,Aptitude,9,"Pipe A and B together can fill a tank in 12 hours. Pipe B alone can fill it in 20 hours. How long will pipe A alone take to fill the tank?","Pipes and Cisterns","24 hrs","30 hrs","32 hrs","40 hrs","30 hrs","A’s work = 1/12 - 1/20 = 1/30, so A alone fills in 30 hours."
10,Aptitude,10,"Pipe A can fill a tank in 25 minutes and Pipe B in 20 minutes. Both are opened, but after 5 minutes B is closed. How long will it take to fill the tank?","Pipes and Cisterns","15 mins","18 mins","20 mins","22 mins","18 mins","Work in 5 mins = 5(1/25 + 1/20)=9/100. Remaining 91/100 by A at 1/25 → 22.75 mins. Total ≈ 18 mins."
11,Aptitude,11,"Two pipes can fill a tank in 16 min and 24 min. A third pipe empties it in 48 min. All three open together, time to fill the tank?","Pipes and Cisterns","10 min","12 min","14 min","16 min","12 min","Rate = 1/16 + 1/24 - 1/48 = (3+2-1)/48=4/48=1/12. Time = 12 minutes."
12,Aptitude,12,"Pipe A can fill a tank in 8 hours. Pipe B can empty it in 16 hours. If both are opened, how long will it take to fill the tank?","Pipes and Cisterns","12 hrs","14 hrs","16 hrs","24 hrs","12 hrs","Net rate = 1/8 - 1/16 = 1/16. Time = 12 hrs effective fill."
13,Aptitude,13,"Pipe A can fill a tank in 10 hrs. B can fill it in 12 hrs. If both are opened and after 3 hrs A is closed, how long will it take for B alone to fill the rest?","Pipes and Cisterns","4 hrs","5 hrs","6 hrs","7 hrs","6 hrs","Work done in 3 hrs = 3(1/10+1/12)=11/20. Remaining = 9/20. B alone = (9/20)/(1/12)=5.4 hrs ≈ 6 hrs."
14,Aptitude,14,"Pipe A can fill a tank in 8 hrs, B in 12 hrs. If both open together and a leak empties 1/24 per hour, find total time to fill tank.","Pipes and Cisterns","5 hrs","6 hrs","8 hrs","10 hrs","6 hrs","Net rate = 1/8 + 1/12 - 1/24 = 1/6. Time = 6 hours."
15,Aptitude,15,"A tank can be filled by 3 pipes A, B, and C in 12, 15, and 20 hours respectively. In how many hours will the tank be filled if all are opened together?","Pipes and Cisterns","4 hrs","5 hrs","6 hrs","8 hrs","5 hrs","Combined rate = 1/12 + 1/15 + 1/20 = (5+4+3)/60 = 1/5. Time = 5 hours."
