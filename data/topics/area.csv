4,Aptitude,Q4,"The percentage increase in the area of a rectangle, if each of its sides is increased by 20% is:",Area,"20%","40%","44%","48%","44%","Original area = xy. New area = 1.2x * 1.2y = 1.44xy. %increase = (1.44xy - xy)/xy*100 = 44%."
5,Aptitude,Q5,"A rectangular park 60 m long and 40 m wide has two concrete crossroads running in the middle of the park and rest of the park has been used as a lawn. If the area of the lawn is 2109 sq. m, then what is the width of the road?",Area,"2 m","3 m","4 m","5 m","3 m","Area of park=2400, Lawn=2109 → area of roads=291. Let width=x → 60x + 40x - x^2=291 → x^2-100x+291=0 → x=3 m."

8,Aptitude,Q3,"A man walked diagonally across a square lot. Approximately, what was the percent saved by not walking along the edges?",Area,"25%","28%","30%","32%","30%","Side=x. Along edges=2x, diagonal=√2x ≈1.41x, saving=0.59x → % saving=0.59/2*100≈30%."
9,Aptitude,Q4,"The diagonal of a rectangle is 41 cm and its area is 20 sq. cm. The perimeter of the rectangle must be:",Area,"18 cm","20 cm","22 cm","24 cm","18 cm","l^2+b^2=41, lb=20, (l+b)^2=l^2+b^2+2lb=41+40=81 → l+b=9 → perimeter=2(l+b)=18 cm."
