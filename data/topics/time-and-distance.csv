1,Aptitude,Q1,"A person crosses a 600 m long street in 5 minutes. What is his speed in km per hour?",Time And Distance,"6 km/hr","7.2 km/hr","8 km/hr","9 km/hr","7.2 km/hr","Speed = Distance/Time = 600 m / (5*60 s) = 2 m/s; Convert to km/hr: 2 * 18/5 = 7.2 km/hr"
2,Aptitude,Q2,"An aeroplane covers a certain distance at a speed of 240 kmph in 5 hours. To cover the same distance in 1 hour, it must travel at a speed of:",Time And Distance,"480 km/hr","600 km/hr","720 km/hr","800 km/hr","720 km/hr","Distance = 240*5 = 1200 km; Time = 1 hour; Speed = 1200/1 ≈ 720 km/hr"
3,Aptitude,Q3,"If a person walks at 14 km/hr instead of 10 km/hr, he would have walked 20 km more. The actual distance travelled by him is:",Time And Distance,"40 km","50 km","60 km","70 km","50 km","Let distance = x km. Extra distance due to speed difference = 20 km. Solve x/10 - x/14 = time difference; x = 50 km"
4,Aptitude,Q4,"A train can travel 50% faster than a car. Both start from point A at the same time and reach point B 75 km away. Train lost 12.5 min stopping. Speed of the car is:",Time And Distance,"100 km/hr","120 km/hr","150 km/hr","180 km/hr","120 km/hr","Let car speed = x, train speed = 1.5x; Solve: 75/x = 75/1.5x + 12.5/60 → x = 120 km/hr"
5,Aptitude,Q5,"Excluding stoppages, speed of a bus is 54 kmph; including stoppages, 45 kmph. Minutes bus stops per hour?",Time And Distance,"10 min","12 min","15 min","20 min","10 min","Distance lost due to stoppages = 54-45=9 km; Time lost = 9/54*60 = 10 min"
6,Aptitude,Q1,"In a flight of 600 km, aircraft slowed by 200 km/hr; flight time increased by 30 min. Duration of flight?",Time And Distance,"1 hr","1.5 hr","2 hr","2.5 hr","1 hr","Let duration = x hr; Solve: 600/(v-200) = x+0.5, 600/v = x; Solving gives x = 1 hr"
7,Aptitude,Q2,"A man completes a journey in 10 hours. First half at 21 km/hr, second half at 24 km/hr. Total journey?",Time And Distance,"200 km","224 km","240 km","256 km","224 km","Let total distance = 2*x; Time = x/21 + x/24 =10 → x = 112; Total distance = 224 km"
8,Aptitude,Q3,"Ratio between speeds of two trains is 7:8. Second train runs 400 km in 4 hr. Speed of first train?",Time And Distance,"80 km/hr","87.5 km/hr","90 km/hr","92 km/hr","87.5 km/hr","Second train speed = 400/4 =100 km/hr; x = 100/8=12.5; First train = 7*12.5=87.5 km/hr"
9,Aptitude,Q4,"A man travels first 160 km at 64 km/hr, next 160 km at 80 km/hr. Average speed for first 320 km?",Time And Distance,"70 km/hr","71.11 km/hr","72 km/hr","73 km/hr","71.11 km/hr","Total time = 160/64 + 160/80 = 2.5+2=4.5 hr; Average speed = 320/4.5 ≈71.11 km/hr"
10,Aptitude,Q5,"A car travels 42 km in 1 hr 40 min 48 sec at 5/7 of actual speed. Actual speed?",Time And Distance,"30 km/hr","32 km/hr","35 km/hr","36 km/hr","35 km/hr","Time =1.68 hr; Actual speed = 42/(5/7 *1.68) = 35 km/hr"
11,Aptitude,Q1,"In covering 30 km, Abhay takes 2 hr more than Sameer. If Abhay doubles speed, he takes 1 hr less than Sameer. Abhay's speed?",Time And Distance,"4 km/hr","5 km/hr","6 km/hr","7 km/hr","5 km/hr","Let Abhay speed = x; Solve: 30/x -30/(2x) = 2+1 → x = 5 km/hr"
12,Aptitude,Q2,"Robert cycles to reach point A at 2 P.M. if at 10 kmph; at 15 kmph he reaches at 12 noon. Speed to reach at 1 P.M.?",Time And Distance,"10 km/hr","12 km/hr","15 km/hr","20 km/hr","12 km/hr","Distance = 60 km; Time difference = 2 hr; Start time = 8 AM; Required speed = 60/5 = 12 km/hr"
13,Aptitude,Q3,"600 km journey: 120 km by train rest by car in 8 hr; 200 km by train rest by car in 8 hr 20 min. Speed ratio train:car?",Time And Distance,"3:4","4:5","5:6","6:7","3:4","Let train = x, car = y; Solve equations from times → x = 60, y = 80; Ratio 60:80 = 3:4"
14,Aptitude,Q4,"Farm travelled 61 km in 9 hr; partly on foot 4 km/hr, partly by bicycle 9 km/hr. Distance on foot?",Time And Distance,"15 km","16 km","17 km","18 km","16 km","Let foot distance = x; Solve: x/4 + (61 - x)/9 = 9 → x = 16 km"
15,Aptitude,Q5,"Man covered distance; 3 km/hr faster → 40 min less; 2 km/hr slower → 40 min more. Distance?",Time And Distance,"30 km","35 km","40 km","45 km","40 km","Let distance = x, speed = y; Solve equations from time differences → x = 40 km"
