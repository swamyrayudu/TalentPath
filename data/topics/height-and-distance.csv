1,Aptitude,Q1,"Two ships are sailing on the two sides of a lighthouse. The angles of elevation of the top of the lighthouse from the ships are 30° and 45° respectively. If the lighthouse is 100 m high, the distance between the two ships is:",Height And Distance,"250 m","273 m","200 m","300 m","(b)","Let AB be the lighthouse and C,D be positions of the ships. AB = 100 m, angle ACB = 30°, angle ADB = 45°. Distance AC = AB*tan(30°)⁻¹ = 100*√3 ≈ 173 m, AD = AB*tan(45°)⁻¹ = 100 m. Distance between ships CD = AC + AD = 173 + 100 ≈ 273 m."
2,Aptitude,Q2,"A man standing at point P observes the top of a tower at an angle of elevation 30°. He walks towards the tower and the angle of elevation becomes 60°. What is the distance between the base of the tower and point P?",Height And Distance,"50 m","Data inadequate","60 m","40 m","(b)","Without the actual height of the tower or distance moved, we cannot determine the distance from point P to the tower base."
3,Aptitude,Q3,"The angle of elevation of a ladder leaning against a wall is 60°, and the foot of the ladder is 4.6 m away from the wall. The length of the ladder is:",Height And Distance,"8.2 m","9.2 m","10 m","9 m","(b)","Let AC = distance of foot from wall = 4.6 m, angle = 60°. Ladder BC = AC / cos(60°) = 4.6 / 0.5 = 9.2 m."
4,Aptitude,Q4,"An observer 1.6 m tall is 20√3 m away from a tower. The angle of elevation from his eye to the top of the tower is 30°. The height of the tower is:",Height And Distance,"20 m","21 m","21.6 m","22 m","(c)","Let CE = observer height = 1.6 m, BE = distance = 20√3 m, angle = 30°. DE = BE * tan(30°) = 20 m. Total tower height CD = CE + DE = 1.6 + 20 = 21.6 m."
5,Aptitude,Q5,"From a point P on level ground, the angle of elevation to the top of a tower is 30°. If the tower is 100 m high, the distance of point P from the foot of the tower is:",Height And Distance,"173 m","180 m","160 m","150 m","(a)","Distance AP = AB / tan(30°) = 100 / (1/√3) = 100*√3 ≈ 173 m."
6,Aptitude,Q6,"The angle of elevation of the sun when the length of the shadow of a tree is 3 times the height of the tree is:",Height And Distance,"30°","45°","60°","25°","(a)","Let AC = shadow length = 3*AB. tan(angle) = AB / AC = AB / (3*AB) = 1/3 → angle = 30°."
