1,Aptitude,Q1,"An accurate clock shows 8 o'clock in the morning. Through how many degrees will the hour hand rotate when the clock shows 2 o'clock in the afternoon?",Clock,"150°","180°","210°","120°","180°","Hour hand moves 30° per hour. From 8 AM to 2 PM = 6 hours → 6×30 = 180°."
2,Aptitude,Q2,"The reflex angle between the hands of a clock at 10:25 is:",Clock,"170°","175°","197.5°","180°","197.5°","Hour hand = 10×30 + (25/60)×30 = 312.5°, Minute hand = 25×6 = 150°, Reflex angle = 360 - (312.5 - 150) = 197.5°."
3,Aptitude,Q3,"A clock is started at noon. By 10 minutes past 5, the hour hand has turned through:",Clock,"155°","157°","160°","162°","155°","Hour hand moves 30°/hour. From 12:00 to 5:10 = 5 hours 10 min = 5+10/60 hours → Angle = 5.1667×30 ≈ 155°."
4,Aptitude,Q4,"A watch which gains 5 seconds in 3 minutes was set right at 7 a.m. In the afternoon of the same day, when the watch indicated quarter past 4 o'clock, the true time is:",Clock,"4:00 PM","4:05 PM","4:10 PM","4:15 PM","4:00 PM","Watch gains 5 sec per 3 min. Total time from 7:00 to 16:15 = 555 min → Gain = 555×5/3 ≈ 925 sec ≈ 15 min. Correct time = 16:15 - 15 min = 16:00."
5,Aptitude,Q5,"How much does a watch lose per day, if its hands coincide every 64 minutes?",Clock,"28 min","32 8/11 min","30 min","35 min","32 8/11 min","Hands coincide every 65 5/11 min in a correct clock. Actual = 64 min → Loss = 65 5/11 - 64 = 1 5/11 min per coincidence. 22 coincidences/day → Total loss ≈ 32 8/11 min."
6,Aptitude,Q1,"At what time between 7 and 8 o'clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but not together?",Clock,"7:25 min","7:27 3/11 min","7:28 min","7:30 min","7:27 3/11 min","Hands in straight line but not together → 180° apart. Minute hand gains 180° in 60 min → Required time = 7:27 3/11."
7,Aptitude,Q2,"At what time between 5:30 and 6 will the hands of a clock be at right angles?",Clock,"5:36 4/11","5:43 7/11","5:40","5:45","5:43 7/11","Minute hand must gain 90° + 5 spaces → Time = 43 7/11 min past 5."
8,Aptitude,Q3,"The angle between the minute hand and the hour hand of a clock when the time is 4:20, is:",Clock,"10°","20°","15°","12°","10°","Hour hand = 4×30 + 20/60×30 = 130°, Minute hand = 20×6 = 120°, Angle = 130 - 120 = 10°."
9,Aptitude,Q4,"At what angle the hands of a clock are inclined at 15 minutes past 5?",Clock,"65°","67.5°","70°","72°","67.5°","Hour hand = 5×30 + 15/60×30 = 157.5°, Minute hand = 15×6 = 90°, Angle = 157.5 - 90 = 67.5°."
10,Aptitude,Q5,"At 3:40, the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock form an angle of:",Clock,"120°","130°","140°","150°","130°","Hour hand = 3×30 + 40/60×30 = 110°, Minute hand = 40×6 = 240°, Angle = 240 - 110 = 130°."
11,Aptitude,Q1,"How many times are the hands of a clock at right angle in a day?",Clock,"22","24","44","48","44","Hands are at right angles 22 times in 12 hours → 44 times in 24 hours."
12,Aptitude,Q2,"The angle between the minute hand and the hour hand of a clock when the time is 8:30, is:",Clock,"75°","80°","70°","65°","75°","Hour hand = 8×30 + 30/60×30 = 255°, Minute hand = 30×6 = 180°, Angle = 255 - 180 = 75°."
13,Aptitude,Q3,"How many times in a day, are the hands of a clock in straight line but opposite in direction?",Clock,"20","22","24","26","22","Hands point opposite 11 times in 12 hours → 22 times in 24 hours."
14,Aptitude,Q4,"At what time between 4 and 5 o'clock will the hands of a watch point in opposite directions?",Clock,"4:54 6/11","4:55","4:53","4:52","4:54 6/11","Hands 180° apart → Minute hand gains 50 spaces → Time = 54 6/11 min past 4."
15,Aptitude,Q5,"At what time between 9 and 10 o'clock will the hands of a watch be together?",Clock,"9:45","9:49 1/11","9:50","9:48","9:49 1/11","Minute hand must gain 45 spaces → Time = 49 1/11 min past 9."
16,Aptitude,Q1,"At what time, in minutes, between 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock, both the needles will coincide each other?",Clock,"16 4/11","16","17","15 5/11","16 4/11","Minute hand must gain 15 spaces → Time = 16 4/11 min past 3."
17,Aptitude,Q2,"How many times do the hands of a clock coincide in a day?",Clock,"20","22","24","12","22","Hands coincide 11 times in 12 hours → 22 times in 24 hours."
18,Aptitude,Q3,"How many times in a day, the hands of a clock are straight?",Clock,"40","42","44","46","44","Hands coincide or opposite 22 times in 12 hours → 44 times in 24 hours."
19,Aptitude,Q4,"A watch which gains uniformly is 2 minutes low at noon on Monday and is 4 min. 48 sec fast at 2 p.m. on the following Monday. When was it correct?",Clock,"Tuesday 2 PM","Wednesday 2 PM","Monday 2 PM","Thursday 2 PM","Wednesday 2 PM","Watch gains 34 min in 170 hrs → Correct at 50 hrs after start → Wednesday 2 PM."
