1,Aptitude,Q1,"A boat can travel with a speed of 13 km/hr in still water. If the speed of the stream is 4 km/hr, find the time taken by the boat to go 68 km downstream.",Boats And Streams,"3 hrs","4 hrs","5 hrs","6 hrs","4 hrs","Speed downstream = 13 + 4 = 17 km/hr → Time = Distance / Speed = 68 / 17 = 4 hrs."

The man's speed against the current is:",Boats And Streams,"10 km/hr","12.5 km/hr","15 km/hr","17.5 km/hr","10 km/hr","Speed in still water = 15 - 2.5 = 12.5 km/hr → Speed against current = 12.5 - 2.5 = 10 km/hr."
3,Aptitude,Q3,"A boat running upstream takes 8 hours 48 minutes to cover a certain distance, while it takes 4 hours to cover the same distance running downstream. What is the ratio between the speed of the boat and speed of the water current respectively?",Boats And Streams,"8:3","3:8","5:2","2:5","8:3","Let speed downstream = y, upstream = x. Distance = same → 8.8x = 4y → y + x : y - x = 8:3."
4,Aptitude,Q4,"A motorboat, whose speed in 15 km/hr in still water goes 30 km downstream and comes back in a total of 4 hours 30 minutes. The speed of the stream (in km/hr) is:",Boats And Streams,"3 km/hr","4 km/hr","5 km/hr","6 km/hr","5 km/hr","Let stream speed = x → Downstream = 15 + x, Upstream = 15 - x. 30/(15+x) + 30/(15-x) = 4.5 → Solve x = 5 km/hr."
5,Aptitude,Q5,"In one hour, a boat goes 11 km/hr along the stream and 5 km/hr against the stream. The speed of the boat in still water (in km/hr) is:",Boats And Streams,"6 km/hr","7 km/hr","8 km/hr","9 km/hr","8 km/hr","Speed in still water = (11 + 5)/2 = 8 km/hr."
6,Aptitude,Q1,"A boat running downstream covers a distance of 16 km in 2 hours while for covering the same distance upstream, it takes 4 hours. What is the speed of the boat in still water?",Boats And Streams,"5 km/hr","6 km/hr","7 km/hr","8 km/hr","6 km/hr","Downstream speed = 16/2 = 8 km/hr, upstream speed = 16/4 = 4 km/hr → Speed in still water = (8 + 4)/2 = 6 km/hr."
7,Aptitude,Q2,"The speed of a boat in still water is 15 km/hr and the rate of current is 3 km/hr. The distance travelled downstream in 12 minutes is:",Boats And Streams,"3 km","3.6 km","4 km","4.2 km","3.6 km","Downstream speed = 15 + 3 = 18 km/hr → Distance = 18 x (12/60) = 3.6 km."
8,Aptitude,Q3,"A boat takes 90 minutes less to travel 36 miles downstream than to travel the same distance upstream. If the speed of the boat in still water is 10 mph, the speed of the stream is:",Boats And Streams,"2 mph","3 mph","4 mph","5 mph","2 mph","Let stream speed = x → Time difference = 90 min → Solve (36/(10-x) - 36/(10+x)) = 1.5 → x = 2 mph."
9,Aptitude,Q4,"A man can row at 5 kmph in still water. If the velocity of current is 1 kmph and it takes him 1 hour to row to a place and come back, how far is the place?",Boats And Streams,"2 km","2.4 km","3 km","3.5 km","2.4 km","Downstream = 5+1=6 kmph, Upstream = 5-1=4 kmph, Let distance = x → x/6 + x/4 =1 → x = 2.4 km."
10,Aptitude,Q5,"A boat covers a certain distance downstream in 1 hour, while it comes back in 1.5 hours. If the speed of the stream be 3 kmph, what is the speed of the boat in still water?",Boats And Streams,"12 km/hr","13 km/hr","14 km/hr","15 km/hr","15 km/hr","Downstream = x+3, Upstream = x-3 → x+3/1 = x-3/1.5 → Solve x = 15 km/hr."
11,Aptitude,Q1,"A boatman goes 2 km against the current of the stream in 1 hour and goes 1 km along the current in 10 minutes. How long will it take to go 5 km in stationary water?",Boats And Streams,"1 hr 10 min","1 hr 15 min","1 hr 20 min","1 hr 25 min","1 hr 15 min","Downstream = 1 km/10 min = 6 km/hr, upstream = 2 km/1 hr = 2 km/hr → Speed in still water = (6+2)/2 = 4 km/hr → Time = 5/4 = 1.25 hr = 1 hr 15 min."
12,Aptitude,Q2,"A man can row three-quarters of a kilometre against the stream in 11 minutes and down the stream in 7 minutes. The speed (in km/hr) of the man in still water is:",Boats And Streams,"4 km/hr","5 km/hr","6 km/hr","7 km/hr","5 km/hr","Upstream speed = 0.75 km / (11/60 hr) = 4.09 km/hr, downstream = 0.75/(7/60) = 6.43 km/hr → Speed in still water = (4.09+6.43)/2 ≈ 5 km/hr."
13,Aptitude,Q3,"Speed of a boat in standing water is 9 kmph and the speed of the stream is 1.5 kmph. A man rows to a place at a distance of 105 km and comes back to the starting point. The total time taken by him is:",Boats And Streams,"20 hr","21 hr","22 hr","24 hr","24 hr","Upstream = 9-1.5=7.5 km/hr, downstream=9+1.5=10.5 km/hr → Time = 105/7.5 + 105/10.5 ≈ 24 hr."
14,Aptitude,Q4,"A man takes twice as long to row a distance against the stream as to row the same distance in favour of the stream. The ratio of the speed of the boat (in still water) and the stream is:",Boats And Streams,"2:1","3:1","4:1","5:1","3:1","Let rate upstream = x, downstream = 2x → Speed in still water : stream = (2x+x)/2 : (2x-x)/2 = 3:1."
15,Aptitude,Q5,"A man rows to a place 48 km distant and come back in 14 hours. He finds that he can row 4 km with the stream in the same time as 3 km against the stream. The rate of the stream is:",Boats And Streams,"0.5 km/hr","1 km/hr","1.5 km/hr","2 km/hr","1 km/hr","Let 4 km downstream in x hr = 3 km upstream in x hr → x = 1 → Downstream speed = 4 km/hr, Upstream = 3 km/hr → Stream speed = (4-3)/2 = 1 km/hr."
