1,Aptitude,Q1,"From a group of 7 men and 6 women, five persons are to be selected to form a committee so that at least 3 men are there on the committee. In how many ways can it be done?","Permutation and Combination","624","720","756","840","756","We can have (3 men, 2 women) or (4 men, 1 woman) or (5 men). Required ways = (7C3×6C2) + (7C4×6C1) + (7C5) = 525 + 210 + 21 = 756."
2,Aptitude,Q2,"In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'LEADING' be arranged in such a way that the vowels always come together?","Permutation and Combination","540","600","720","840","720","Treat the vowels (EAI) as one unit. Then 5 units (L, N, D, G, EAI) can be arranged in 5! ways, and vowels among themselves in 3! ways. Total = 5!×3! = 720."
3,Aptitude,Q3,"In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'CORPORATION' be arranged so that the vowels always come together?","Permutation and Combination","40320","25200","50400","20160","50400","Vowels (OOAIO) are treated as one unit → 7 units (CRPRTN + vowels). Considering repetition of R twice: 7!/2! × 5!/3! = 2520×20 = 50400."
4,Aptitude,Q4,"Out of 7 consonants and 4 vowels, how many words of 3 consonants and 2 vowels can be formed?","Permutation and Combination","15120","20160","25200","30240","25200","Ways to select = (7C3×4C2) = 210, and arrangement = 5! = 120 → Total = 210×120 = 25200."
5,Aptitude,Q5,"In how many ways can the letters of the word 'LEADER' be arranged?","Permutation and Combination","120","240","360","720","360","The word has 6 letters with 2 Es repeating. Number of ways = 6!/2! = 360."
6,Aptitude,Q6,"In a group of 6 boys and 4 girls, four children are to be selected such that at least one boy should be there. How many ways can this be done?","Permutation and Combination","205","209","215","220","209","We can have 1–4 boys: (6C1×4C3)+(6C2×4C2)+(6C3×4C1)+(6C4) = 24+90+80+15 = 209."
7,Aptitude,Q7,"How many 3-digit numbers can be formed from digits 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9, which are divisible by 5 and none of the digits repeat?","Permutation and Combination","15","20","25","30","20","Since divisible by 5, last digit = 5. Remaining 2 positions can be filled by 5×4 = 20 ways."
8,Aptitude,Q8,"In how many ways a committee consisting of 5 men and 6 women can be formed from 8 men and 10 women?","Permutation and Combination","5880","8400","11760","15600","11760","Ways = 8C5 × 10C6 = 56 × 210 = 11760."
9,Aptitude,Q9,"A box contains 2 white, 3 black, and 4 red balls. In how many ways can 3 balls be drawn if at least one black ball is included?","Permutation and Combination","54","60","64","70","64","Possible cases: (1B,2NB)+(2B,1NB)+(3B) = (3C1×6C2)+(3C2×6C1)+(3C3) = 45+18+1=64."
10,Aptitude,Q10,"In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'DETAIL' be arranged so that vowels occupy only the odd positions?","Permutation and Combination","12","24","36","48","36","There are 3 vowels and 3 consonants. Vowels can go to positions 1,3,5 → 3! ways; consonants → 3! ways. Total = 6×6 = 36."
11,Aptitude,Q11,"In how many ways can a group of 5 men and 2 women be made out of a total of 7 men and 3 women?","Permutation and Combination","42","56","63","70","63","Ways = 7C5×3C2 = 21×3 = 63."
12,Aptitude,Q12,"How many 4-letter words can be formed from the letters of 'LOGARITHMS' if repetition is not allowed?","Permutation and Combination","2100","3024","5040","7200","5040","Total letters = 10 distinct. Required = 10P4 = 10×9×8×7 = 5040."
13,Aptitude,Q13,"In how many ways can the letters of 'MATHEMATICS' be arranged so that the vowels always come together?","Permutation and Combination","90720","100800","120960","150000","120960","Treat AEAI as one → 8 letters (M,T,H,M,T,C,S,AEAI), M & T repeated twice → 8!/(2!×2!) = 10080; vowels = 4!/2! = 12; total = 10080×12=120960."
14,Aptitude,Q14,"In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'OPTICAL' be arranged so that the vowels always come together?","Permutation and Combination","540","600","720","840","720","Treat OIA as one → 5 units (P,T,C,L,OIA) → 5!×3! = 720."
15,Aptitude,Q15,"From 8 men and 5 women, a committee of 4 members is to be formed. How many ways if at least 2 men must be included?","Permutation and Combination","320","420","500","550","420","Possible cases: (2M,2W)+(3M,1W)+(4M)=8C2×5C2+8C3×5C1+8C4=28×10+56×5+70=420."
