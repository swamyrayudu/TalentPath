1,Aptitude,Q1,"In a 100 m race, A can give B 10 m and C 28 m. In the same race B can give C:","Races And Games","18 m","20 m","22 m","25 m","20 m","A : B = 100 : 90. A : C = 100 : 72. When B runs 100 m, C runs 72 x 100 / 90 = 80 m. B can give C 20 m."
2,Aptitude,Q2,"A and B take part in 100 m race. A runs at 5 kmph. A gives B a start of 8 m and still beats him by 8 seconds. The speed of B is:","Races And Games","3.9 kmph","4.14 kmph","4.5 kmph","5 kmph","4.14 kmph","A's speed = 5 kmph = 5*1000/3600 ≈ 1.389 m/s. Time taken by A to cover 100 m = 100/1.389 ≈ 72 sec. B runs 92 m in 80 sec → speed of B = 92/80 * 3.6 ≈ 4.14 kmph."
3,Aptitude,Q3,"In a 500 m race, the ratio of the speeds of two contestants A and B is 3 : 4. A has a start of 140 m. Then, A wins by:","Races And Games","10 m","15 m","20 m","25 m","20 m","A covers 360 m (500-140). In that time, B covers 4/3 * 360 = 480 m. B is 20 m behind. A wins by 20 m."
4,Aptitude,Q4,"In a 100 m race, A beats B by 10 m and C by 13 m. In a race of 180 m, B will beat C by:","Races And Games","4 m","5 m","6 m","7 m","6 m","A : B = 100 : 90, A : C = 100 : 87. Ratio B:C = 90:87 = 30:29. When B runs 180 m, C runs 174 m. B beats C by 6 m."
5,Aptitude,Q5,"At a game of billiards, A can give B 15 points in 60 and A can give C 20 points in 60. How many points can B give C in a game of 90?","Races And Games","10 points","12 points","15 points","18 points","10 points","A:B = 60:45, A:C=60:40 → B:C = 45:40. In 90 points game, B gives C 10 points."
6,Aptitude,Q6,"In a race of 200 m, A can beat B by 31 m and C by 18 m. In a race of 350 m, C will beat B by:","Races And Games","20 m","22 m","25 m","30 m","25 m","A:B = 200:169, A:C = 200:182 → B:C = 169:182. When C runs 350 m, B runs 169*350/182 ≈ 325 m. C beats B by 25 m."
7,Aptitude,Q7,"In 100 m race, A covers the distance in 36 seconds and B in 45 seconds. In this race A beats B by:","Races And Games","15 m","18 m","20 m","25 m","20 m","Time difference = 45-36=9 sec. B covers 100*9/45 = 20 m less. A beats B by 20 m."
8,Aptitude,Q8,"In a game of 100 points, A can give B 20 points and C 28 points. Then, B can give C:","Races And Games","8 points","9 points","10 points","12 points","10 points","A:B=100:80, A:C=100:72 → B:C = 80:72 = 10:9. In 100 point game, B gives C 10 points."
9,Aptitude,Q9,"In a 200 metres race A beats B by 35 m or 7 seconds. A's time over the course is:","Races And Games","33 sec","34 sec","35 sec","36 sec","33 sec","B runs 35 m in 7 sec → speed B = 5 m/s. Time for 200 m → 200/6.06 ≈ 33 sec. A's time = 33 sec."
10,Aptitude,Q10,"A can run 22.5 m while B runs 25 m. In a kilometre race B beats A by:","Races And Games","90 m","100 m","110 m","120 m","100 m","Ratio of distances = 22.5:25 = 9:10 → in 1000 m, A runs 900 m. B beats A by 100 m."
11,Aptitude,Q11,"In a 300 m race A beats B by 22.5 m or 6 seconds. B's time over the course is:","Races And Games","75 sec","80 sec","85 sec","90 sec","80 sec","B covers 22.5 m in 6 sec → speed B = 3.75 m/s. Time for 300 m = 300/3.75 = 80 sec."
