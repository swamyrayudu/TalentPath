1,Aptitude,Q1,"Tickets numbered 1 to 20 are mixed up and then a ticket is drawn at random. What is the probability that the ticket drawn has a number which is a multiple of 3 or 5?","Probability","2/5","3/10","9/20","1/3","9/20","Multiples of 3 or 5 are {3,5,6,9,10,12,15,18,20}, total 9. Probability = 9/20."
2,Aptitude,Q2,"A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?","Probability","8/21","9/21","10/21","11/21","10/21","Total ways = 7C2 = 21. Non-blue = 5C2 = 10. So probability = 10/21."
3,Aptitude,Q3,"In a box, there are 8 red, 7 blue and 6 green balls. One ball is picked up randomly. What is the probability that it is neither red nor green?","Probability","1/3","2/7","7/21","8/21","1/3","Only blue balls (7) are neither red nor green. Probability = 7/21 = 1/3."
4,Aptitude,Q4,"What is the probability of getting a sum 9 from two throws of a dice?","Probability","1/6","1/9","1/12","1/18","1/9","Combinations giving 9: (3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3) → 4 out of 36. Probability = 4/36 = 1/9."
5,Aptitude,Q5,"Three unbiased coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting at most two heads?","Probability","1/8","3/4","7/8","1/2","7/8","Total outcomes = 8. At most two heads = 7 outcomes. Probability = 7/8."
6,Aptitude,Q6,"Two dice are thrown simultaneously. What is the probability of getting two numbers whose product is even?","Probability","1/2","3/4","5/6","2/3","3/4","Favorable outcomes = 27, total = 36. Probability = 27/36 = 3/4."
7,Aptitude,Q7,"In a class, there are 15 boys and 10 girls. Three students are selected at random. The probability that 1 girl and 2 boys are selected is:","Probability","21/46","7/23","10/23","15/46","21/46","Ways = 10C1×15C2 = 1050, total = 25C3 = 2300, Probability = 1050/2300 = 21/46."
8,Aptitude,Q8,"In a lottery, there are 10 prizes and 25 blanks. A lottery is drawn at random. What is the probability of getting a prize?","Probability","2/7","3/7","4/7","1/5","2/7","Probability = 10/(10+25) = 10/35 = 2/7."
9,Aptitude,Q9,"From a pack of 52 cards, two cards are drawn together at random. What is the probability of both the cards being kings?","Probability","1/221","1/169","1/110","1/52","1/221","Total ways = 52C2 = 1326, ways to draw 2 kings = 4C2 = 6. Probability = 6/1326 = 1/221."
10,Aptitude,Q10,"Two dice are tossed. The probability that the total score is a prime number is:","Probability","1/3","5/12","7/18","1/2","5/12","Prime sums: 2,3,5,7,11 → 15 outcomes. Probability = 15/36 = 5/12."
11,Aptitude,Q11,"A card is drawn from a pack of 52 cards. The probability of getting a queen of club or a king of heart is:","Probability","1/13","1/26","1/52","1/12","1/26","Two favorable cards (queen of clubs, king of hearts). Probability = 2/52 = 1/26."
12,Aptitude,Q12,"A bag contains 4 white, 5 red and 6 blue balls. Three balls are drawn at random from the bag. The probability that all of them are red is:","Probability","1/45.5","1/91","1/15","2/91","2/91","Ways to choose 3 red = 5C3 = 10, total = 15C3 = 455, Probability = 10/455 = 2/91."
13,Aptitude,Q13,"Two cards are drawn together from a pack of 52 cards. The probability that one is a spade and one is a heart is:","Probability","11/102","13/102","17/102","9/102","13/102","Ways to draw = 13×13 = 169, total = 1326. Probability = 169/1326 = 13/102."
14,Aptitude,Q14,"One card is drawn at random from a pack of 52 cards. What is the probability that the card drawn is a face card (Jack, Queen and King only)?","Probability","1/13","3/13","2/13","1/12","3/13","There are 12 face cards. Probability = 12/52 = 3/13."
