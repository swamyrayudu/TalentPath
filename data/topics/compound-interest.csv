The sum (in Rs.) is:",Compound Interest,"Rs. 625","Rs. 600","Rs. 650","Rs. 640","Rs. 625","Let sum = x. S.I. = 2x*4/100 = 8x/100, C.I. = x*(1+4/100)^2 - x = 8.16x/100, Difference = 0.16x = 1 → x = 625."

11,Aptitude,Q1,"Simple interest on a certain sum of money for 3 years at 8% per annum is half the compound interest on Rs. 4000 for 2 years at 10% per annum. The sum placed on simple interest is:",Compound Interest,"Rs. 1750","Rs. 1800","Rs. 1700","Rs. 1600","Rs. 1750","C.I. on 4000 = 4000*(1+10/100)^2 - 4000 = 1680, Half = 840 → SI = 840 = P*3*8/100 → P = 1750."
12,Aptitude,Q2,"If the simple interest on a sum of money for 2 years at 5% per annum is Rs. 50, what is the compound interest on the same at the same rate and for the same time?",Compound Interest,"Rs. 51.25","Rs. 50","Rs. 52","Rs. 53","Rs. 51.25","Principal = 500 → C.I. = 500*(1+5/100)^2 - 500 = 51.25."
