If the digits are in ratio 1:2, find difference between sum and difference of digits.","Problems On Numbers","6","7","8","9","8","Let digits 2x, x → difference=(20x+x)-(10x+2x)=9x=36 → x=4. Sum-difference=(2x+x)-(2x-x)=3x- x=2x=8."
105,Aptitude,Q5,"A two-digit number has product of digits 8. When 18 is added, digits are reversed. Find the number.","Problems On Numbers","28","34","48","84","28","Let digits x and y. xy=8. 10x+y+18=10y+x → 9x-9y= -10 → solve quadratic x=2 → number=28."
106,Aptitude,Q1,"Sum of digits of two-digit number is 15, difference is 3. Find the number.","Problems On Numbers","69","75","96","57","96","Let digits x,y. x+y=15, x-y=3 → x=9,y=6 → number=96. Also possible 69 if order reversed."
107,Aptitude,Q2,"Sum of squares of three numbers=138, sum of products two at a time=131. Find their sum.","Problems On Numbers","18","19","20","21","20","(a+b+c)^2 = a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca)=138+2*131=400 → a+b+c=20."
108,Aptitude,Q3,"A two-digit number. If digits interchange and added to original, resulting number divisible by?","Problems On Numbers","9","10","11","12","11","Number=10x+y, reversed=10y+x → sum=11(x+y) → divisible by 11."
109,Aptitude,Q4,"Two-digit number whose unit digit exceeds ten's by 2 and number*(sum of digits)=144.","Problems On Numbers","24","26","28","32","24","Let ten's=x, unit=x+2 → number=10x+(x+2)=11x+2, sum=2x+2 → (11x+2)(2x+2)=144 → x=2 → number=24."
110,Aptitude,Q5,"Find positive number which increased by 17 equals 60 times its reciprocal.","Problems On Numbers","2","3","4","5","3","x+17=60/x → x^2+17x-60=0 → (x+20)(x-3)=0 → x=3."
111,Aptitude,Q1,"Product of two numbers=9375, quotient of larger by smaller=15. Sum of numbers?","Problems On Numbers","375","400","425","450","400","Let numbers y (smaller), x=15y → xy=9375 → 15y*y=9375 → y^2=625 → y=25 → x=375 → sum=400."
112,Aptitude,Q2,"Product of two numbers=120, sum of squares=289. Find their sum.","Problems On Numbers","21","22","23","24","23","x^2+y^2=289, xy=120 → (x+y)^2=x^2+y^2+2xy=289+240=529 → x+y=23."
