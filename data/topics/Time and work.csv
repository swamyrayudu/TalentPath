1,Aptitude,Q1,"A can do a work in 15 days and B in 20 days. If they work on it together for 4 days, then the fraction of the work that is left is :",Problems on Numbers,"1/4","7/15","1/2","8/15","8/15","A's 1 day's work = 1/15; B's 1 day's work = 1/20; (A + B)'s 1 day's work = 1/15 + 1/20 = 7/60; (A + B)'s 4 days' work = 28/60 = 7/15; Remaining work = 1 - 7/15 = 8/15"
2,Aptitude,Q2,"A can lay railway track between two given stations in 16 days and B can do the same job in 12 days. With help of C, they did the job in 4 days only. Then, C alone can do the job in:",Problems on Numbers,"6 days","9 3/5 days","12 days","8 days","9 3/5 days","(A + B + C)'s 1 day's work = 1/4; A's 1 day's work = 1/16; B's 1 day's work = 1/12; C's 1 day's work = 1/4 - (1/16 + 1/12) = 1/48; C alone can do the work in 48 days = 9 3/5 days"
3,Aptitude,Q3,"A, B and C can do a piece of work in 20, 30 and 60 days respectively. In how many days can A do the work if he is assisted by B and C on every third day?",Problems on Numbers,"12 days","15 days","18 days","20 days","15 days","A's 2 day's work = 2/20 = 1/10; (A + B + C)'s 1 day's work = 1/20 + 1/30 + 1/60 = 1/10; Work done in 3 days = 1/10 + 1/10 = 1/5; Whole work will be done in 3*5 = 15 days"
4,Aptitude,Q4,"A is thrice as good as workman as B and therefore is able to finish a job in 60 days less than B. Working together, they can do it in:",Problems on Numbers,"40 days","45 days","50 days","60 days","45 days","Ratio of times taken by A and B = 1:3; Difference = 60 days; So B takes 90 days, A takes 30 days; A's 1 day = 1/30, B's 1 day = 1/90; (A+B)'s 1 day = 1/30 + 1/90 = 4/90 = 2/45; Work together = 45/2 = 22.5 days"
5,Aptitude,Q5,"A alone can do a piece of work in 6 days and B alone in 8 days. A and B undertook to do it for Rs. 3200. With the help of C, they completed the work in 3 days. How much is to be paid to C?",Problems on Numbers,"Rs. 400","Rs. 500","Rs. 600","Rs. 700","Rs. 400","C's 1 day's work = 1/3 - (1/6 + 1/8) = 1/24; A:B:C = 1/6:1/8:1/24 = 4:3:1; C's share for 3 days = 3*(1/24)*3200 = Rs. 400"
6,Aptitude,Q1,"If 6 men and 8 boys can do a piece of work in 10 days while 26 men and 48 boys can do the same in 2 days, the time taken by 15 men and 20 boys in doing the same type of work will be:",Problems on Numbers,"3 days","4 days","5 days","6 days","4 days","Let 1 man's 1 day = x, 1 boy's 1 day = y; 6x + 8y = 1/10, 26x + 48y = 1/2; Solve: x = 1/100, y = 1/200; 15 men + 20 boys = 15/100 + 20/200 = 1/4; Time = 1 / (1/4) = 4 days"
7,Aptitude,Q2,"A can do a piece of work in 4 hours; B and C together can do it in 3 hours, while A and C together can do it in 2 hours. How long will B alone take to do it?",Problems on Numbers,"10 hours","12 hours","15 hours","8 hours","12 hours","A's 1 hr = 1/4; (B+C)'s 1 hr = 1/3; (A+C)'s 1 hr = 1/2; (A+B+C) = 1/4 + 1/3 = 7/12; B = 7/12 - 1/2 = 1/12; B alone = 12 hours"
8,Aptitude,Q3,"A can do a certain work in the same time in which B and C together can do it. If A and B together could do it in 10 days and C alone in 50 days, then B alone could do it in:",Problems on Numbers,"20 days","25 days","30 days","35 days","25 days","(A+B)'s 1 day = 1/10; C's 1 day = 1/50; (A+B+C) = 1/10 + 1/50 = 3/25; A's 1 day = B+C = 1/25; B alone = 1/25 - 1/50 = 1/50; B alone = 25 days"
9,Aptitude,Q4,"A does 80% of a work in 20 days. He then calls in B and they together finish the remaining work in 3 days. How long B alone would take to do the whole work?",Problems on Numbers,"50 days","60 days","75 days","80 days","75 days","Whole work = 20 / 0.8 = 25 days; 1 day's work = 1/25; Remaining = 20%; A+B 3 days = 0.2; 1 day's work = 0.2/3 = 1/15; B alone = 1/15 - 1/25 = 1/75; B alone = 75 days"
10,Aptitude,Q5,"A machine P can print one lakh books in 8 hours, machine Q can print the same number of books in 10 hours while machine R can print them in 12 hours. All the machines are started at 9 A.M. while machine P is closed at 11 A.M. and the remaining two machines complete work. Approximately at what time will the work be finished?",Problems on Numbers,"12:30 PM","1 PM","1:30 PM","2 PM","1 PM","(P+Q+R) 1 hr work = 1/8+1/10+1/12=37/120; 2 hrs = 37/60; Remaining = 1-37/60=23/60; (Q+R) 1 hr = 1/10+1/12=11/60; Time = (23/60)/(11/60) ≈ 2.09 hrs; Work finishes ≈ 11+2 ≈ 1 PM"
