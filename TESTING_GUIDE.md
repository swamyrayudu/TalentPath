## 🔧 Testing Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multiple Languages
Test the same problem with different languages:

**Python:**
```python
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
target = int(input())
seen = {}
for i, num in enumerate(nums):
    if target - num in seen:
        print(seen[target - num], i)
        break
    seen[num] = i
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

let lines = [];
rl.on('line', (line) => {
    lines.push(line);
    if (lines.length === 2) {
        const nums = lines[0].split(' ').map(Number);
        const target = parseInt(lines[1]);
        
        const seen = new Map();
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            const complement = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.has(complement)) {
                console.log(seen.get(complement), i);
                process.exit(0);
            }
            seen.set(nums[i], i);
        }
        rl.close();
    }
});
```

**Java:**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] numsStr = sc.nextLine().split(" ");
        int[] nums = new int[numsStr.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < numsStr.length; i++) {
            nums[i] = Integer.parseInt(numsStr[i]);
        }
        int target = sc.nextInt();
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
                System.out.println(seen.get(complement) + " " + i);
                return;
            }
            seen.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

---

### Scenario 2: Time Limit Exceeded
Test with infinite loop:

```python
while True:
    pass  # This will timeout after 10 seconds
```

**Expected:** "Time Limit Exceeded" error

---

### Scenario 3: Runtime Error
Test with syntax/runtime error:

```python
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
target = int(input())
print(nums[999])  # Index out of range
```

**Expected:** "Runtime Error" with error message

---

## 📊 Database Verification

After testing, verify data in database:

### Check Contests Table
```sql
SELECT id, title, status, visibility, created_by FROM contests;
```

### Check Questions Table
```sql
SELECT id, title, difficulty, points FROM contest_questions;
```

```

### Check Participants Table
```sql
SELECT contest_id, user_id, joined_at FROM contest_participants;
```

### Check Submissions Table
```sql
SELECT id, verdict, score, passed_test_cases, total_test_cases 
FROM contest_submissions 
ORDER BY submitted_at DESC;
```

### Check Leaderboard Table
```sql
SELECT rank, user_id, total_score, problems_solved, total_time_minutes 
FROM contest_leaderboard 
ORDER BY rank ASC;
```
